                <p>
                Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and 
                AeroBuddies and governs your use of the AeroBuddies services, superseding any 
                prior version of this TOS between you and AeroBuddies with respect to the 
                AeroBuddies services. You also may be subject to additional terms and 
                conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other AeroBuddies 
                services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.
                </p>
                <p>
                Choice of Law and Forum. You and AeroBuddies each agree that the TOS and 
                the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the 
                South Africa or the country in which you participate in our programs 
                without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all 
                claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out 
                of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship between you and 
                AeroBuddies shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in South 
                Africa or your country. You and AeroBuddies agree to submit to the 
                personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the South Africa or 
                your country, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of 
                jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of AeroBuddies to exercise or enforce any 
                right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
                If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be 
                invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect 
                to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of 
                the TOS remain in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your 
                AeroBuddies account is non-transferable and any rights to your AeroBuddies 
                services or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon 
                receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated 
                and all contents therein permanently deleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the 
                contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the 
                AeroBuddies services, or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such 
                claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the 
                TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
                </p>
